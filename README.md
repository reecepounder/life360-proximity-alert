## Life360 Proximity Alert
### A proximity alert system using Pushover - customizable range and notification settings.

This is a different method altoghether than regular bubbles in Life360, as they do not move with you. This program allows you to detect proximity to YOU, not to a fixed position. Great for large-scale games of Tag or Senior Assasain.

_Note: At present the code does not have Pushover support. Time will tell whether I can be bothered to update it.
As of right now, the code just prints to console the distance to the user in miles of each person every 10s. _


`python > all`
