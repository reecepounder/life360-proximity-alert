# life360-proximity-alert
A proximity alert system using Pushover - customizable range and notification settings. This is different to regular locations in Life360, as it lets you know if someone is near you, not your home or workplace. Great for games like Senior Assasain, where you must be aware if someone is nearby at all times.


i don't know how to use git, so i uploaded everything from the website. mock me later.
